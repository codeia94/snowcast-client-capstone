# Project Title
SnowCast

## Overview

Be In-The-Know with Snowfall forecast.

### Problem

For enthusiasts of winter sports like skiing and snowboarding, preparing for a trip to ski resorts involves checking snowfall and weather forecasts to ensure optimal conditions. Currently, this process is cumbersome as it requires visiting multiple ski resort websites individually. Each of these websites may have different layouts and functionalities, making it a time-consuming and often frustrating task to gather all the necessary information. This disjointed approach can lead to missed opportunities for the best snow conditions and unnecessarily complicated trip planning. SnowCast aims to eliminate this redundancy and streamline the information gathering process by providing a centralized platform for accurate and comprehensive snowfall forecasts.
